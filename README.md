When the program first starts, you are provided with a login interface.
	If its a new user, the program creates the account and adds its info into the database.
	If its a returning user, the program opens the account from the database.

Once successfully in, the user can add tasks by clicking the textfield at the bottom and typing
what the task is supposed to do. The task is added to the repository, and remains there until completed
or deleted.

A current task has 3 options present for the user.
	1. Tapping the square means the task is completed.
	2. Tapping the 'x' means the task is deleted.
	3. Tapping the task name itself allows the task name to be edited.

Selecting the user icon in the top right changes the username of the current login to whatever the
user types.

Selecting the door icon in the top right logs the user out.
